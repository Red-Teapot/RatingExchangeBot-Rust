## Pre-commit checks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to perform `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`
checks before each commit automatically. This helps improve the code quality. Please install
pre-commit as described on its [website](https://pre-commit.com/#install).

Every time you try to commit your changes, pre-commit will run the necessary checks and
if any of them fails, it won't let you to make the commit. If that happens, fix the issues
and try again.
